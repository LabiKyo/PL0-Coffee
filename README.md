## What's This?

Just as the name implies, this is a PL/0 compiler implement using CoffeeScript. It is a homework assignment of BUAA Software Engineering's compiler course. [**Shao Bin**](mailto:shaobing@buaa.edu.cn) is the lecturer of this course.

I'm asked to implement PL/0 compiler using C, C++, C# or Java, but I haven't been coding static languages for a long time, and more familiar with scripting languages like Ruby, CoffeeScript/JavaScript, Python. After searching the internet I found there's no public CoffeeScript implementation, it can prove that I implement this compiler myself.

## Why You Create This Repository?

CoffeeScript is now my favorite language and it can be compiled to browser compatible native javascript. So anyone who has a browser can run this compiler. That's much more compatible than C or C++, and doesn't need extra setups.
